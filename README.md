## This library is not maintained
I wrote this when I was a sophomore in college, and I was still getting the hang of programming.
I briefly considered rewriting this library to be more modern and have higher code quality. But I chose not to for a couple of reasons

1. Performing a network call for every Wordnet access is bad and can potentially slow down your application
2. Projects like RitaWN have integrated local Word Net solutions for Android

WonetLib
========

Welcome to WONET, a relatively pain free way to get the power of the WordNet in your Android applications,
this is the source for the jar, just import it into eclipse and export it as a runnable JAR.
The project is in alpha, feel free to contribute
